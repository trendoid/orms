Object-relational mappers enable developers to work with relational databases like Microsoft SQL using the languages they know and love.  Sometimes that means that the developers don’t know the underlying queries and statements being sent to the database.  This doesn’t mean that the developers don’t love SQL.  It just means that they don’t know it yet.
 
In this session, we’ll look at the latest builds of [Microsoft’s Entity Framework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework), and see what programming tools developers use to work with SQL databases.  We’ll also take a look at [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize).  Sequelize is an open source ORM written in JavaScript for Node.js.  
 
We’ll take a look at code first development, advanced querying techniques, connecting to existing databases and migrations.  We’ll also take a look at lazy and eager loading techniques.  We’ll take a look at these two ORM’s from the eyes of the developer and the DBA.
 
Developers and DBA’s need to live together in harmony.  After attending this session, you can come to the ORM conversation with your developer or DBA happily.
