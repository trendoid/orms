                    ## Aaron Stanley King

                    Programming is not only my profession but also my hobby and integrated into my lifestyle.  I think that computers and technology help me lead a more fulfilling life and make best use of my time.  My family, friends, and co-workers would call me a geek or nerd.  I am proud of those titles.  I have always been working with a website in various forms since 1996.  I grew up with computers and technology. I don't know what I would be like without that.

                    ##Manifesto for Agile Software Development

                    We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

                    **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

                    **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

                    **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

                    **Responding to change** over following a plan
                    
                    That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

                    ##Database First

                    - Puts the responsibility on the SQL Developer
                    - Best if 'execute only' practices followed
                    - Can leverage existing databases                    
                    - The code generated can be cumbersome and slow
                    - Diagnosing issues can be a problem

                    ##Code First

                    - Puts the responsibility on the backend or full-stack developer
                    - Best of TDD practices can be followed
                    - Only the code needed is created
                    - Can leverage existing databases but more work to merge

                    Stored Procedures in a code first environment aren't that much fun to maintain. 
                    Don't do it.  Just decide to go execute only and thin out your data layer.
